# Practice 01: Thinking with data (no execution yet)

# 1. Imagine a small dataset
# Example: number of books read per month
book_read = [2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 0, 2]

# 2. Questions we might ask
# - How many months are there?
# - What is the total number of books read?
# - What is the average per month?
# - Are there months with no reading?

# 3. We are NOT solving yet.
# We are Learning to think in questions.
