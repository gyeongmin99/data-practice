## Goal
Understand what code does, not memorize syntax

## What I expect to learn

- Lists and dictionaries
- Simple loops and conditions

## Reflection
(To be filled)

## First Practice Reflection

### What is data here?
- A list of number representing monthly reading activity

### What kind of questions feel natural?

### Why this matters for data analysis
- Data analysis starts from questions, not from code
