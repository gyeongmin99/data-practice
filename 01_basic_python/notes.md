# 01. Basic Python - Notes

## Goal
Understand what code does, not memorize syntax

## What I expect to learn
- Variables
- Lists and dictionaries
- Simple loops and conditions

## Reflection
(To be filled)

## First Practice Reflection

### What is data here?
- A list of number representing monthly reading activity

### What kind of questions feel natural?
- Total amount
- Average
- Presence of zero values

### Why this matters for data analysis
- Data analysis starts from questions, not from code


## Basic Calculation Results

- Total books read: 13
- Number of months: 8
- Average per month: about 1.6 books

## Interpretation
- Reading activity is irregular: some months have zero reading.
- The average alone does not fully describe the pattern.
- Additional analysis (e.g., distribution) may be needed.

## Additional Statistics

- Minimum books per month: 0
- Maximum books per month: 4
- Months with zero reading: 2

## Interpretation
Although the average number of books per month is about 1.6,
there is high variation across months.
Some months show no reading at all, which the average alone does not reveal.
